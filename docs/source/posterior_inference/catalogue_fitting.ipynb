    "\n",
    "Synference has a method specifically for fitting catalogues of sources - `fit_catalogue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is designed to be a flexible and fast way to fit your full catalogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can handle:\n",
    "1. Transforming observations to match the expected model features.\n",
    "2. Prior predictive checks/outlier detection to remove sources that are unlikely to be well modelled.\n",
    "3. Optional imputation of missing data.\n",
    "4. Rapid posterior inference using trained model.\n",
    "5. Optional SED recovery (see [this notebook](sed_recovery.ipynb) for more details).\n",
    "6. Returning structured results."
