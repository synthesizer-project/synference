    "A variation of SBI is Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE), where the model is trained online, i.e., in multiple rounds. In each round, simulations are generated from the current posterior estimate, and the model is updated with these new simulations. This approach can be more efficient in terms of simulation budget, especially when the prior is broad and the posterior is narrow.\n",

    "However, the model is no longer amortized, as it is specialized to the specific observation after training. This means that a new model must be trained for each new observation, which can be computationally expensive if many observations need to be analyzed."
