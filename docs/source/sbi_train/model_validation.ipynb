    "# Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation is a crucial step in the machine learning workflow to ensure that the model performs well and assess any biases or overfitting. Here are some common techniques used for model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synference supports a variety of model validation techniques, including:\n",
    "- **Train/Test Split**: Dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "- **Validation Plots**: Visualizations such as training loss, model coverage, and prediction distributions to assess model behavior.\n",
    "- **Prior Predictive Checks**: Evaluating the model's predictions based on prior distributions to ensure they align with domain knowledge.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and others to quantify model performance.\n"

    "### Splitting Validation Data by SNR\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model incorporates a noise model, it is often useful to validate the model's performance across different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This can help identify if the model performs consistently across varying levels of observational uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To split your validation data by SNR, you can use this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "fitter.plot_parameter_deviations(\n",
    "    snr_bins=[5, 10, 10, 1000]\n",
