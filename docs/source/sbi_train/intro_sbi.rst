Training SBI Models
*******************

In this section, we provide an overview of the various methods for training Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) models in Synference. Training an SBI model is a crucial step in the simulation-based inference workflow, as it allows us to learn the relationship between model parameters and synthetic observables from a library of pre-computed simulations or via online learning.
