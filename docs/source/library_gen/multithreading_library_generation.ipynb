    "In the previous sections, we demonstrated how to generate model libraries using Synference's built-in library generation capabilities. However, for large-scale model libraries, the generation process can be time-consuming. To address this, Synference supports multithreaded library generation, allowing you to parallelize the computation across multiple CPU cores and even multiple nodes in a computing cluster.\n",

    "The idea, is that if in ```GalaxyBasis.create_mock_library```, you set ```multi_node=True``` and you run the script in MPI, that the galaxies will be split across the ranks. This allows for a two-tiered parallelization process, where the galaxies are split across multiple nodes, and each node has a batch of galaxies to process, which can be split over the cores in that node. This is enabled through the Synthesizer ```Pipeline``` functionality."
