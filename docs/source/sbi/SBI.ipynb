    "$$p(\\theta | x) = \\frac{p(x | \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(\\theta)$ is the prior, $p(x | \\theta)$ is the likelihood, and $p(x) = \\int p(x | \\theta) p(\\theta) d\\theta$ is the evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many scientific domains we often have a simulator that can generate data, $x \\sim p(x | \\theta)$, and a prior over our model parameters, $\\theta \\sim p(\\theta)$, but no tractable likelihood function, $p(x | \\theta)$. In SED fitting, this simulator corresponds to codes that can generate realistic astrophysical spectra given some model parameters. However, in most cases these codes do not provide a flexible likelihood function, $p({\\rm spectrum} | \\theta)$, since this would require integrating over the complex physics of the simulator, which is intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "SBI leverages these simulations to learn the statistical relationship between parameters and data using machine learning methods. Instead of deriving likelihoods analytically, SBI takes many simulations: $(θ_i, x_i)$ where $\\theta_i \\sim p(\\theta)$, $x_i \\sim p(x|\\theta_i)$, and uses neural networks to learn probability distributions from these samples. These learned distributions can be used to perform inference.\n"

    "The key to SBI is using flexible neural networks to represent probability distributions.  Galaxy SED fitting posteriors can be challenging: strong degeneracies exist between age and metallicity, between dust and redshift, and multimodal posteriors can occur when multiple SFH solutions fit equally well to the data. This is why the choice of density estimator matters. We list here some of the most common architectures.\n",

    "\n",
    "SBI has a number of key advantages over traditional methods. It works with implicit likelihoods; there is no need to derive complex probability densities. Amortization means that you can train once, and apply to many observations cheaply (for NPE). It is scalable, since modern neural networks can handle high-dimensional data. And it does not require hand-crafted distance metrics (unlike ABC).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SBI also has a number of challenges. Clear diagnostics are required to evaluate the accuracy of the learnt relationships, as well as convergence. SBI also still requires many simulations for training, and is susceptible to extrapolation errors outside the training data distribution. Finally, stochastic simulators require special handling for variance.\n",
